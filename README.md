# üåø Juniper üçá

A React component library.

Work in progress personal project of React components built on pure CSS variables.

**This project is still in progress~**

## ‚ú® Getting Started

Install with either package manager.

```bash
yarn add juniper-ui
```

```bash
npm install juniper-ui
```

After installation, import the CSS into your app's entry file.

```jsx
import "juniper-ui/dist/style.css";
```

## üî® Development

The project's UI library files are in `package/`.

The project's documentation is a `Next.js` project, in the folder `src/`. You can run the below to start that up.

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Using CSS and SCSS

Juniper is fully customizable from CSS only. Variables and CSS classes can be rewritten. Development uses SCSS purely for some nesting and helpers -- no SCSS variables.

Final `dist/` compiles to CSS.

## üñç Props & Patterns

Generally, Juniper uses the following prop types.

| Prop       | Type                                                           | Description                                                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| intent     | `primary` \| `secondary` \| `success` \| `danger` \| `warning` | The semantic "meaning" for a user.                                                             |
| appearance | `fill` \| `outline` \| `minimal` \| `warning`                  | Alternative styles for components. Not necesarily meant to signal different semantic meanings. |
| color      | `gray` \| `red` \| `orange` \| `amber` \| ...                  |                                                                                                |
