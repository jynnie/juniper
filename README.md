# Juniper

A React component library.

Work in progress personal project of React components built on pure CSS variables.

**This project is still in progress~**

## Getting Started

The project's site is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```

## Thoughts

- use sections, main, and p tags
