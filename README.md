# 🌿 Juniper 🫐

A React component library.

Work in progress personal project of React components built on pure CSS variables.

**This project is still in progress~**

## Getting Started

The project's site is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```

### Using CSS and SCSS

Juniper is fully customizable from CSS only. Variables and CSS classes can be rewritten. Development uses SCSS purely for some nesting and helpers -- no SCSS variables.

Final dist/ compiles to CSS.

## Credits

This project builds on top of other components. Notably,

- [UI Box](https://github.com/segmentio/ui-box)
- [React Select](https://react-select.com/)

## Thoughts

- use sections, main, and p tags
