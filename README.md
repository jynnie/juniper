# 🌿 Juniper 🍇

A React component library.

Work in progress personal project of React components built on pure CSS variables.

**This project is still in progress~**

## ✨ Getting Started

Install with either package manager.

```bash
yarn add juniper-ui
```

```bash
npm install juniper-ui
```

After installation, import the CSS into your app's entry file.

```jsx
import "juniper-ui/dist/style.css";
```

## 🔨 Development

Project files are in `src/`. Additionally you can test with Storybook or the Next.js pages.

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Using CSS and SCSS

Juniper is fully customizable from CSS only. Variables and CSS classes can be rewritten. Development uses SCSS purely for some nesting and helpers -- no SCSS variables.

Final `dist/` compiles to CSS.
